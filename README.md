## UX

When designing this webpage I wanted to achieve a balance of professionalism with a sense of calm and cleanliness.

### Colour Scheme

By choosing the colours below, I hoped to achieve the calm and cleanliness feeling.

- `#FFFFFF` used all throughout the site primarily on text elements.
- `#000000` also used all throughout the site mainly on text and border elements.
- `#87CEEB` used all throughout the site, its main use being a background-color.
- `#0B3D91` used all throughout the site, its uses being: buttons and main elements such as cards.
- `#F8F9FA` used all throughout the site, it is the main background colour for the site.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/87ceeb-0b3d91-000000-f8f9fa-ffffff) to generate my colour palette.
