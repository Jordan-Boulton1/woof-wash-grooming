## UX

When designing this webpage I wanted to achieve a balance of professionalism with a sense of calm and cleanliness.

### Colour Scheme

By choosing the colours below, I hoped to achieve the calm and cleanliness feeling.

- `#FFFFFF` used all throughout the site primarily on text elements.
- `#000000` also used all throughout the site mainly on text and border elements.
- `#87CEEB` used all throughout the site, its main use being a background-color.
- `#0B3D91` used all throughout the site, its uses being: buttons and main elements such as cards.
- `#F8F9FA` used all throughout the site, it is the main background colour for the site.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/87ceeb-0b3d91-000000-f8f9fa-ffffff) to generate my colour palette.

## Database Design

Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) help to visualize database architecture before creating models.
Understanding the relationships between different tables can save time later in the project.

```mermaid 
erDiagram
Users  ||--o{  Pets  : fk_Users_Pets
Users  ||--|{  Appointments  : fk_Users_Appointments
Services  ||--||  Appointments  : fk_Services_Appointments

Users {
int id
varchar(50) first_name
varchar(50) last_name
varchar(255) email
varchar(50) password
varchar(30) phone
varchar(100) address
int role
}

Services {
int service_id
varchar(50) service_name
varchar(500) description
money price
}

Pets  {
int pet_id
varchar(255) name
varchar(50) breed
int age
varchar(255) medical_notes
int user_id
}

Appointments  {
int id
int client_id
int service_id
int timeslot_id
int status
dateTime startdate
dateTime enddate
boolean is_booked
}
```

I have used [mermaidchart](https://www.mermaidchart.com/)  to generate an ERD.

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/Jordan-Boulton1/woof-wash-grooming/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project.
It isn't a specialized tool, but with the right tags and project creation/issue assignments, it can be made to work.

Through it, user stories, issues, and milestone tasks were planned, then tracked on a weekly basis using the basic Kanban board.

![screenshot](https://github.com/Jordan-Boulton1/woof-wash-grooming/blob/main/documentation/readme/kanban-board.png)

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Jordan-Boulton1/woof-wash-grooming/issues) served as an another Agile tool.
There, I used my own **User Story Template** to manage user stories.

It also helped with milestone iterations on a weekly basis.
